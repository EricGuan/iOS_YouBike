# iOS_YouBike
This is an open source iOS app project that aims to check youbike availability at your location with least manual operations.  
Upper mapview detects your update location and make a route between you and the stop, while if the closest stop dosen't provide enough youbike, you may manually click the list below to make route with another stop.  
In this app, you don't have to pinch the screen at must, so you may use this app with single hand.
